# Class 2 Reading Notes

## Markdown

+ **What is It?**
  + Markdown is a coding language that utilizes a simpler syntax to emphasize ease of readibility within code.
 + **Why Use It?**
   + Markdown is highly accessible since it is platform independent (meaning it can run on any device) and is *future proof* as it can still be read even if the application being previously used no longer functions.
