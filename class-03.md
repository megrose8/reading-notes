##Revisions and the Cloud
**Version Control**
+Local Version Control *(VCS)*: One database on your hard disk, storing continuous changes of files. VCS is at work when one writes code and saves it to *their* computer's file explorer.
+Centralized Version Control *(CVCS)*: A single server that stores all changes and versions of files, allowing access by various clients and/or teams of developers. The invention of this method of version control allowed for greater ease in collaboration and control over revision privileges.
+Distributed Version Control *(DVCS)*: Eliminates vulnerability of a single server. DVCS allows mirrored repositories to elimate the risk of lost information due to a single server's failure. The mirroring of repositories further enables use of multiple collaborators on a project.

**Cloning**
+Allows for copying of existing GIT repositories into other locations. Cloning initiates the copying of all versions of all files for a project.
    + 'git clone https:// INSERT LINK'
