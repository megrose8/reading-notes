## HTML Hyperlinks
* HTML Hyperlinks use the `<a>` element and the `href` attribute (also known as the hypertext reference) which contains the web address.
* To make a block level element a link anchor the code snippet in `<a>` elements  
* Images: To make an image a link use `<a>` around the `<img src=` attribute.  
* When creating hyperlinks, use alt text to make the content accessible.

## CSS Layout
* Normal flow is how the webpage elements lay themselves out if they are not changed.
* Block level elements appear on a new line after the last one with each seperated by the specified margin.
* Positioning: Takes elements out of default flow and make them behave differently.  
    * Relative Positioning: Once positioned element exists, you can modify final position making it overlap other elements. However, after you give the relative declaration, you still need to use top, bottom, left, and right to move the positioned element.
    * Absolute Positioning: Allows an element to exxist on another layer above everything else. (Pop-up info boxed, control menus, etc.)
    * To change stacking order use z-index 
    * Fixed Positioning: Fixes to viewport, no matter how much page scrolls. `position: fixed;`To make it fix to a certain part of the screen such as the top use the `top:0` attribute and `margin-top:0`

##  JS Functions
* Functions: store a piece of code and call it using short commands. Using () can hint that a function is being created.
* Invoking a function: Using the name of the function followed by ()
* Parameters, values that need to be included within the () for the job to be done correctly when called.
* Anonymous Functions: Exist when there is a function that receives another function as a parameter.
* Arrow functions: Alternative to anonymus functions. Utilize this by using `(event) =>`
* Scope: Each variable within the function have their own seperate scope. However, the top level is the global scope. To ensure there are not conflicts, using code locked in functions helps avoid conflicting variables and functions that may produce errors.
