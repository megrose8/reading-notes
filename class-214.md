## Psychological Safety  
[Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?    
Everyone having equal time to speak(conversational turn taking), social sensitivity and intuition of cues, interpersonal trust, mutual respect.
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.    
When I was in a research team in college, and on in which I currently am still in, I feel that the psychological safety has decreased over time. I feel self-conscious at times if I am speaking too much, or if I'm saying the right thing. I think that the lack of communication from some members of the group (not responding to texts, etc) has made me less confident in the level to which they respect my work or if they want me on the team. This has created an environment in which it can be emotionally draining and stressful to go to meetings. 
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members.  
Teams with a high degree of psychological safety lead to greater results and innovation. This can lead to better company performance, and strong bonds between team members.
