# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling: 
* Process of creating conceptual models for a specific problem.   
* Entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors: *object-oriented model*  

### Defining constructors and initializing properties:  
* Constructor function is defined as a function expression. Variable is declated and assigned a function within parameters. 
* Function called- data inside parameters are stored inside properties.   
* Following function definition: Objects instasiated with the `new` keyword and properties initialized using constructor function name.    
* Prototypes substitute objects to allow for shared code and therefore the consumption of less memory.
**In Summary**   
1. `New` keyword instsantiates (creates) the object  
2. Constructor function initializes properties using the `this` variable.   
3. Object is stored in a variable for later use. 
4. Store objects within variables to access properties and methods from the outside.  
5. Use `this` variable to access properties and methods from the inside.
