**All About HTML**
+ *HTML*: Hypetext Markup Language defines the structure of your content that allows the developer to enclose or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear of act a certain way.    
    + *HTML Elements*: `<p> This is an HTML Example </p>`  
        + `<p>` is the opening tag. In the example above `This is an HTML Example` is classified as the content. `</p>` is referred to as the closing tag. The entire thing from opening to content to close is called an `element.`
    + HTML Elements may also have extra information called **Attributes** that allow information that will not actually appear in the content. These provide identifiers that allow them to be targeted specifically. The two types of attributes are: Classes (for non-unique identifiers) and IDs (for specific identifiers.) 
+ *Semantics* refer to the meaning of the code. In HTML., it identifies the role that the text plays. For example `h1` tells the user this a top level heading on the page. Semantics allow for clear coding and enhance accessiblity for those who may use screen readers or other devices used to increase accessibility.
