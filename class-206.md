# Problem Domain, Object, and the DOM
## Things I would like to know more about: 

## Java Script Object Basics
* Object: Collection of related data and/or functionality  
    * Creating an object begins with defining and initializing a variable.  
    * Object: Each object has a name and a value. Pairs are selerated by a comma and name/ value are seperated by a colon.  
    * Values of objects can be anything:   
        * Data items: Object properties  
        * Methods: Functions tat allow the object to do something with that data.   
    * Dot Notation:   
* Object Literal: Literally writing out object components as we create it.  
* `This` keyword refers to the current object the cide is being written inside of.  
* `New` is the keyword to create constructors. When called, constructorsd can create a new objecyt, bind `this` to the new objecytt, run the code, and return the new object.

## Introduction to the DOM 
*  DOM: Document Object Model: Programming interface for web documents, representng the page so programs can change structure, style, and content. Allows for manipulation of documents in browser windows or HTML sources.  
    * DOM can be manipulated using JavaScript  
    * Properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects.
    * `Document` : Root of document itself  
    * `Window` : Browser
