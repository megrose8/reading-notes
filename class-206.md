# Problem Domain, Object, and the DOM
## Things I would like to know more about: 

## Java Script Object Basics
* Object: Collection of related data and/or functionality  
    * Creating an object begins with defining and initializing a variable.  
    * Object: Each object has a name and a value. Pairs are selerated by a comma and name/ value are seperated by a colon.  
    * Values of objects can be anything:   
        * Data items: Object properties  
        * Methods: Functions tat allow the object to do something with that data. 

## Introduction to the DOM 
* DOM: Document Object Model
