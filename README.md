# My Code Fellows Reading Notes

## About Me :sparkling_heart:
My name is Meg and I live in Portand, Oregon, but I grew up in Eastern Washington. I'm a recent college graduate and work for a non-profit teaching various computer classes to members of the community. 
I've dipped my toes into various fields including working as a project manager for a marketing consultancy, co-founding a interdisplinary humanities lab, and now- teaching! I've ended up in a coding bootcamp with the intention of eventually teaching young adults coding to provide them with marketable skills as the enter the workplace. Outside of work, I am a dog mom, nap enthusiast, and lover of brunch.

## Growth Mindset

*Thinking About the Growth Mindset*

For me, having a growth mindset means to have confidence in oneself alongside the ability to recognize, without judgement, one's strengths, and a willingness to engage with potential spaces for improvement.
A growth mindset resists the temptation to give up when things are hard, and instead encourages the radical act of self love, and the continual need for growth without judgement.

*For When Things Get Hard Remember:*
- No rain, no flowers
- Failure is An opportunity for growth
- I am inspired by the success of others
