# My Code Fellows Reading Notes

## About Me 
My name is Meg and I live in Portand, Oregon, but I grew up in Eastern Washington. I'm a recent college graduate and work for a non-profit teaching various computer classes to members of the community. 
I've dipped my toes into various fields including working as a project manager for a marketing consultancy, co-founding a interdisplinary humanities lab, and now- teaching! I've ended up in a coding bootcamp with the intention of eventually teaching young adults coding to provide them with marketable skills as the enter the workplace. Outside of work, I am a dog mom, nap enthusiast, and lover of brunch.
