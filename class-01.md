## Growth Mindset

*Thinking About the Growth Mindset*

For me, having a growth mindset means to have confidence in oneself alongside the ability to recognize, without judgement, one's strengths, and a willingness to engage with potential spaces for improvement.
A growth mindset resists the temptation to give up when things are hard, and instead encourages the radical act of self love, and the continual need for growth without judgement.

*For When Things Get Hard Remember:*
- No rain, no flowers
- Failure is An opportunity for growth
- I am inspired by the success of others
